This repository contains the implementation of our paper 
"*Shape2Mask: A weakly supervised instance segmentation method for aluminum alloy precipitations based on prior shape knowledge*", 
introducing a novel shape-based instance segmentation framework specifically designed for nanoscale precipitations in TEM images.

## Key Features
- **Shape-Parameterized Prediction**: Replaces traditional pixel-wise mask generation with a parameterized shape regression paradigm, enabling explicit incorporation of geometric prior knowledge and improved handling of blurry or low-contrast structures in TEM images.
- **Differentiable Prior Loss Constraints**: Introduces domain-informed loss functions that directly regularize morphological properties such as aspect ratio and edge straightness, effectively bridging domain knowledge and weakly supervised learning.
- **Hybrid Architecture with GNN and KAN**: Combines Graph Neural Networks for structured shape feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for highly nonlinear parameter fitting, enhancing representational flexibility and regression accuracy under limited supervision.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.1.1+
- Detectron2 follow [Detectron2 installation instructions](https://detectron2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/install.html).
- torch-geometric==2.6.1 (for GNN)
- CUDA 11+ (for GPU acceleration)

### CUDA kernel for MSDeformAttn and Diff rasterizer
Shape2Mask also uses the deformable attention modules introduced in [Deformable-DETR](https://github.com/fundamentalvision/Deformable-DETR) and the differentiable rasterizer introduced in [BoundaryFormer](https://github.com/mlpc-ucsd/BoundaryFormer). Please build them on your system:
``` shell
bash scripts/auto_build.sh
```
or 
``` shell
cd ./modeling/layers/deform_attn
sh ./make.sh
cd ./modeling/layers/diff_ras
python setup.py build install
```

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/neulmc/Shape2mask.git

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

### Training Pipeline
#### 1. Box-supervison instance segmentation
Configure parameters in config file and run:
```bash
python train_net.py
```
Key configurable parameters in config file:
```
cfg_MLP_KAN = True        # KAN enable
cfg_DECODE_GAT = True     # GAT enable
cfg_MERGE = True          # Fusion enable
cfg_shape_layer = 2       # num of shape-KAN module
cfg_point_layer = 2       # num of vertex-KAN module
cfg_POINTS_SHAPE_WEIGHT = 0.1     # The weight of prior loss function
cfg_POINTS_RELA_WEIGHT = 0.1
```
#### 2. Full-supervison instance segmentation

```bash
python train_sup_net.py -stages fine
```
#### 3. Evaluation
The evaluation runs automatically, generating:
- Performance metrics in {method_name}/log.txt
- Prediction visualizations in {method_name}/inference/filename.png 
(*when setting save_visualization = False*)
